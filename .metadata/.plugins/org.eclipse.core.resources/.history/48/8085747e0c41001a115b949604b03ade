//3.	A lawn-mowing service needs a program to work out their pricing strategy. 
//The lawn-mowing season lasts 20 weeks. The weekly fee mowing a lot under 400 m2 is £25. 
//The fee for a lot that is 400 m2 or more but under 600 m2 is £35 per week. The fee for a lot that is over 600 m2 is £50 per week. 
//Prompt the user for the length and width of a lawn and then print the weekly mowing fee, as well as the 20-week seasonal fee.
