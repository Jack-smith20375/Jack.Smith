//Write a program that prompts the user for two integers and then prompts the user to enter an option. If the choice is 1, add the two integers.  
//If it is 2 subtract the second integer from the first and if it is 3, multiply the integers. Display the results of the arithmetic.
//
//Modify the program so the user can enter 4 for divide. If the user enters 4 and the second integer is 0, 
//display an error message "Cannot divide by Zero"; otherwise divide the first number by the second and display the result.
